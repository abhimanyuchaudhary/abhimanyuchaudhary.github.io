    <h1>HabitBot - Habit Tracker Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 19, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Abhimanyu</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") developed the HabitBot - Habit Tracker application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data when you use our App. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.</p>
